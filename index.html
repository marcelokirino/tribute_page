                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Paul William Walker IV (September 12, 1973 - November 30, 2013) 
                    was an American actor. Walker began his career guest-starring in 
                    several television shows such as The Young and the Restless and 
                    Touched by an Angel. Walker gained prominence with breakout roles
                    in coming of age and teen films such as She's All That and 
                    Varsity Blues. In 2001, Walker gained international fame for 
                    his portrayal of Brian O'Conner in the street racing action 
                    film The Fast and the Furious, and would reprise the role in 
                    five of the next six installments. He also starred in films 
                    such as Eight Below, Timeline, Into the Blue, Joy Ride and 
                    Running Scared.
                    Besides acting, Walker was the face of The Coty Prestige 
                    fragrance brand Davidoff Cool Water for Men, and starred 
                    in the National Geographic Channel series, Expedition Great

                    an organization providing relief efforts for areas affected by 
                    natural disasters. He was often praised for his off-screen 
                    charity work, and as a performer.
                    Walker died in a single-vehicle collision on November 30, 2013, 
                    alongside friend Roger Rodas. Three films that he was involved 
                    in at the time were released posthumously: Hours (2013), 
                    Brick Mansions (2014) and Furious 7 (2015). The song 
                    "See You Again" by Wiz Khalifa, which appeared on the Furious 7
                    soundtrack, is a tribute to Walker. The song was nominated 
                    for the Golden Globe Awards for Best Original Song at the 
                    73rd Golden Globe Awards.

                <div class="text">
                    Walker began his small screen career as a toddler, when he 
                    starred in a television commercial for Pampers. He began 
                    modeling at the age of two and began working on television 
                    shows in 1985, with roles in shows such as Highway to Heaven, 
                    Who's the Boss?, The Young and the Restless, and Touched by an 
                    Angel. That same year, he starred in a commercial for Showbiz 
                    Pizza. Walker's film career began in 1986, with the horror/comedy 
                    film Monster in the Closet. In 1987 he appeared in The Retailiator 
                    (aka Programmed to Kill), a low budget cyborg action film, with 
                    Robert Ginty. He and his sister Ashlie were contestants on a 1988 
                    episode of the game show I'm Telling!; they finished in 
                    second place. In 1993 he played Brandon Collins on the CBS soap 
                    opera The Young and the Restless. He and his co-star Heather Tom, 
                    who played Victoria Newman, were nominated for Outstanding Lead 
                    Actor and Actress in a soap opera at the Youth in Film Awards. 
                    In 1998, Walker made his feature film debut in the comedy Meet the 
                    Deedles, which finally gained him fame. This subsequently led to 
                    supporting roles in the movies Pleasantville (1998), Varsity Blues 
                    (1999), She's All That (1999), and The Skulls (2000).
                    In 2001, Walker's breakthrough role arrived when he starred 
                    opposite actor Vin Diesel in the successful action film 
                    The Fast and the Furious, the first film in the franchise. 
                    The film established Walker as a notable film star and leading 
                    man and led to his reprise of the role in the 2003 sequel 
                    2 Fast 2 Furious. He continued his career with leading roles 
                    in films such as Joy Ride (2001), Into the Blue (2005), 
                    and Timeline (2003); he had a supporting role in Clint Eastwood's 
                    adaptation of Flags of Our Fathers (2006).
                    Walker starred in the independent film The Lazarus Project, 
                    which was released on DVD on October 21, 2008. He subsequently 
                    returned to The Fast and the Furious franchise, reprising his 
                    role in Fast & Furious, which was released on April 3, 2009. 
                    Walker then appeared in the crime drama Takers, which began

                The Coty Prestige fragrance brand Davidoff Cool Water for Men 
                announced in January 2011 that Walker was going to be the new

                and Cody as his body doubles/stand-ins, and CGI, and was released 
                in April 2015. Walker was also set to play Agent 47 in the video

                Walker was born in Glendale, California, and was the son of Cheryl 
                (née Crabtree), a fashion model, and Paul William Walker III, a sewer 
                contractor and a fighter who was a two-time Golden Gloves champion. 
                Paul Walkers paternal grandfather had a boxing career as "'Irish'
                Billie Walker". Paul's ancestry was mostly English, with some German,
                Swiss, and Irish. One of his grandfathers raced factory cars for Ford 
                in the 1960s. The oldest of five siblings, Walker was raised primarily
                in the Sunland community of Los Angeles and attended high school in 
                the San Fernando Valley, graduating from Sun Valley's Village 
                Christian School in 1991. He was raised as a member of The Church of 
                3
                Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After high school, Walker attended several community colleges in Southern California, majoring in Marine Biology.
                He held a brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Ricardo "Franjinha" Miller at Paragon Jiu-Jitsu and was awarded his black belt by Miller posthumously.

                Walker held an interest in marine biology; he joined the Board of Directors of The Billfish Foundation in 2006. He fulfilled a lifelong dream by starring in a National Geographic Channel series Expedition Great White (later retitled Shark Men), which premiered in June 2010. He spent 11 days as part of the crew, catching and tagging seven great white sharks off the coast of Mexico. The expedition, led by Chris Fischer, founder and CEO of Fischer Productions, along with Captain Brett McBride and Dr. Michael Domeier of the Marine Conservation Science Institute, took measurements, gathered DNA samples, and fastened real-time satellite tags to the great white sharks. This allowed Dr. Domeier to study migratory patterns, especially those associated with mating and birthing, over a five-year period.
                In March 2010, Walker went to Constitución, Chile, to offer his help and support to the people injured in the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck on February 27. He flew with his humanitarian aid team, Reach Out Worldwide, to Haiti to lend a helping hand to the 2010 Haiti earthquake victims.
                An avid car enthusiast, he competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series in which he raced an M3 E92 and was on the AE Performance Team. His car was sponsored by Etnies, Brembo Brakes, Ohlins, Volk, OS Giken, Hankook, Gintani, and Reach Out Worldwide. Walker had been preparing for an auto show prior to his death.
                Roger Rodas became Walker's financial adviser in 2007 and helped to establish Reach Out Worldwide. Rodas, a pro-am racer was the CEO of Always Evolving, a Valencia high-end vehicle performance shop owned by Walker.
                Walker was close friends with his 2 Fast 2 Furious co-star Tyrese Gibson. Vin Diesel considered Walker to be like a brother, both on and off screen, and affectionately called him "Pablo". Walker's mother referred to her son as Diesel's "other half".

                On November 30, 2013, at approximately 3:30 p.m. PST, Walker and 
                Roger Rodas, 38, left an event for Walker's charity Reach Out 
                Worldwide for victims of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in Rodas's red 
                2005 Porsche Carrera GT. The car crashed into a concrete lamppost 
                and two trees on Hercules Street, in a 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) 
                speed zone near Kelly Johnson Parkway in Valencia, Santa Clarita, 
                California, after which the vehicle burst into flames. The crash was 
                caught on film by a security camera. Authorities determined that 
                Rodas was driving the car while Walker was the passenger. 
                The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department declared both victims 
                dead at the scene. Rodas died of multiple traumatic injuries while 
                Walker died from the combined effects of traumatic and thermal 
                trauma, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. 
                Both of their bodies were burned beyond recognition.

                    The curve where Walker and Rodas were killed is a popular spot for drifting cars. 
                    The coroner's report stated that the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was traveling at a 
                    speed possibly as high as 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) before the crash. 
                    The coroner's report further stated that no alcohol or other drugs were found 
                    in the systems of either man. Furthermore, it states that there were no hints 
                    of technical problems with the car and neither a damaged surface of the street 
                    nor parts on the street played a role in the crash. Police investigated as to 
                    whether drag racing played a role but were unable to find evidence of a second
                    car's involvement. A piece of the car was stolen off the tow truck as the 
                    wreckage was towed away on a flatbed. Two men, Jameson Brooks Witty and Anthony 
                    Janow, were arrested for grand theft.

                Walker's autopsy showed "scant soot" in his trachea, leading investigators to believe
                he died before the car was engulfed in fire, where Rodas was killed on or shortly 
                after impact by head, neck, and chest trauma.
                In March 2014, further investigation revealed that the speed of the car was the 
                main reason for the crash. The car was said to be traveling between 80 miles per 
                hour (130 km/h) and 93 miles per hour (150 km/h) and had nine-year-old tires 
                that were seldom driven on.
                With Furious 7 in the middle of filming at the time of Walker's death, 
                Universal announced an indeterminate hiatus on the production, citing a desire 
                to speak with his family before determining what to do with the film.
                Numerous friends and movie stars posted tributes to Walker on social media. 
                His body was cremated and his ashes were buried in a non-denominational ceremony 
                at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.
                In December 2014, Walker's father, Paul III, filed a lawsuit against 
                Rodas's estate seeking the return of or "a proportionate share" of 
                revenue generated by a group of automobiles that were jointly owned 
                by both Walker and Rodas.
                In September 2015, Walker's daughter Meadow filed a suit against 
                Porsche for wrongful death of her father, claiming that the Porsche 
                Carrera GT had numerous design defects including a history of 
                instability, and that seat belt placement can cause harm upon impact. 
                Porsche's response denied any wrongdoing and blamed Walker himself, 
                stating: "The perils, risk, and danger were open and obvious and known 
                to him, and he chose to conduct himself in a manner so as to expose 
                himself to such perils, dangers, and risks, thus assuming all the 
                risks involved in using the vehicle." In April 2016, a U.S. District 
                Court ruled in favor of Porsche in a separate lawsuit filed by 
                Roger Rodas' widow, Kristine. The ruling has no bearing on two other 
                cases against Porsche which have been filed by Walker's father, 
                who is also the executor of the actor's estate, and his daughter. 
                Both are pending cases at the Los Angeles superior court.
